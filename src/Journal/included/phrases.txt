I am David Abbernel
As a journalist I like to write about the latest stories
I stay objective and keep my readers well informed
Some would describe me as a drama maker
I would say that I have a talent
for finding good stories
Right now I am looking at strange story
A murder in an old apartment complex
There is this haunting feeling
What could it be?
Something is following me.
Following my thoughts.
I should not let it catch me.
Who keeps turning off the lights?
The date is August 12th, 2032.
There has been three murders in this building...
All of which were done by one killer.
They went beserk, wanting something they couldn't get.
